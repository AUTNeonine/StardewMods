**Automate** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you place a chest
next to a machine (like a furnace, cheese press, bee house, etc), and the machine will
automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Usage
_TODO_

## Configuration
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.

## Versions
See [release notes](release-notes.md).
