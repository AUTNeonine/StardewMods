**Lookup Anything** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that shows live info about
whatever's under your cursor when you press `F1`.

This is a very early prototype and isn't ready for general use.

## Installation
1. Install [SMAPI](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI) (0.39.5+).
2. <s>Install this mod from Nexus mods.</s> This mod isn't released yet. If you know what you're
   doing, you can compile the mod yourself to use it.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Usage
Just point your cursor at something and press `F1`. The mod will show live info about that object.

## Examples
Here are some representative screenshots (layout and values will change dynamically as needed).
