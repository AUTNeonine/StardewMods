###Note:  
+ Be careful when tilling your soil because the hoe can destroy your small-medium sized fruit trees.  
+ Tractor Mode doesn't drain your stamina when using Hoe and Water can.  
+ Water can doesn't need to be refilled but needs to have some water in it to work.  
+ You can fertilize your crop AFTER sowing seeds with Tractor Mode.  
+ **Have fun farming! :)**
