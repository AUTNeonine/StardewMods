**Skip Intro** is a minimal [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that skips straight to
the title screen or load screen (configurable) when you start the game. It also skips the screen
transitions, so starting the game is much faster.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Configure
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a message in the SMAPI console. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.
| `SkipToLoadScreen` | Default `true`. Whether to skip straight to the load-save screen (instead of the title screen).

## Versions
