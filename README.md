# Tractor Mod - A SMAPI Mod for Stardew Valley
#### A mod for stardew valley: auto till, water, fertilize, and seed dirt tiles on your farm by simply walking over them. 

Modder: PhthaloBlue  

This is a mod that allows players to quickly till dirt, sow seeds, fertilize soil, and water crop by simple walking over them.  

It is default to only work with iridium tools equipped so that the mod doesnt ruin your early game but you can change that in the config file.

###Latest Version: [1.3](https://github.com/lambui/StardewValleyMod_TractorMod/releases)
####Change Log **v.1.3**:
+ **Add** Global option:
  - You can use Tractor Mode everywhere, no longer limited in the farm.  
  - Turn this mod on by setting globalTractor equal to 1 in config.json. It is 0 (disable) by default.  
+ **Add** ability to harvest fiber-weeds.

+ Be careful when tilling your soil because the hoe can destroy your small-medium sized fruit trees.  
+ Tractor Mode doesn't drain your stamina when using Hoe and Water can.  
+ Water can doesn't need to be refilled but needs to have some water in it to work.  
+ You can fertilize your crop AFTER sowing seeds with Tractor Mode.  
+ Be extra careful with WTFMode haha
+ If you use Horse Mode then you can use [Horse Whistle Mod](https://www.google.com/#q=Horse+Whistle+stardew+valley) to bring your horse into Greenhouse, Coops, or Barns.
+ **Have fun farming! :)**
