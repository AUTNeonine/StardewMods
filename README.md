## Compiling the mods
Installing stable releases from Nexus Mods is recommended for most users. If you really want to
compile the mod yourself, read on.

These mods use the [crossplatform build config](https://github.com/Pathoschild/Stardew.ModBuildConfig#readme)
so they can be built on Linux, Mac, and Windows without changes. See [the build config documentation](https://github.com/Pathoschild/Stardew.ModBuildConfig#readme)
for troubleshooting.

### Compiling a mod for release
To package a mod for release:

1. Delete the mod's directory in `Mods`.  
   <small>(This ensures the package is clean and has default configuration.)</small>
2. Recompile the mod per the previous section.
3. Launch the game through SMAPI to generate the default `config.json` (if any).
4. Delete the `.cache` in the mod folder.
2. Create a zip file of the mod's folder in the `Mods` folder. The zip name should include the
   mod name and version. For example:

   ```
   LookupAnything-1.0.zip
      LookupAnything/
         LookupAnything.dll
         LookupAnything.pdb
         config.json
