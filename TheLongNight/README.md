You just stay awake forever and the night never ends (until you go to bed).

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1369).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
The mod is automatic â€” just stay past 2am, as long as you want.

## Configure
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.

## Versions
See [release notes](release-notes.md).
