# Tractor Mod - A SMAPI Mod for Stardew Valley
#### A mod for stardew valley: auto till, water, fertilize, and seed dirt tiles on your farm by simply walking over it. 

Modder: PhthaloBlue  

This is a mod that allows players to quickly till dirt, sow seeds, fertilize soil, and water crop by simple walking over them.  

It is default to only work with iridium tools equipped so that the mod doesnt ruin your early game but you can change that in the config file.

###How To Use:
1. Get to your farm
2. Turn on Tractor Mode by clicking the hotkey to toggle it on.  
You will receive a +1 speed buff showing that the Tractor Mode is now on.
3. Hold your hoe if you want to till dirt  
Hold water can if you want to water crop  
Hold seed bag(s) to sow seeds  
Hold fertilizer to fertilize tilled soil
4. After you are done with your farmwork, simple click the hotkey again to toggle it off.  
The buff will go away showing that the Mode is now off.


###Customize:  
1. Change tractorKey to change hotkey.  
Default hotkey is B but you can change hotkey by changing the config.json file.  
Check out KeyCode.txt file to find your desirable key code.

2. Change minToolPower to lower the minimum tool upgrade require for the Mod to work.  
0 = no upgrade required  
1 = copper upgrade  
2 = silver  
3 = gold  
4 = iridium, this is default

3. mapWidth and mapHeight is used to estimate the maximum size of your farm.  
Default is 170 for both because I don't think the farm map is bigger than 170 tiles in both directions.  
If you have mod that change your farm to be bigger than default values then make sure to change these values accordingly (don't have to be exact, just bigger is fine).

###Note:  
Be careful when tilling your soil because the hoe can destroy your small-medium sized fruit trees.  
Tractor Mode doesn't drain your stamina when using Hoe and Water can.  
Water can doesn't need to be refill either but needs to have some water in it to work.  
Tractor Mode works when you are on your horse however the horse body will block most of the actions so it doesn't work quite well. But it still work!  
You can fertilize your crop AFTER sowing seeds with Tractor Mode.
